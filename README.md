[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/shopify_python_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Shopify/shopify_python_api)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ShopifyAPI.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ShopifyAPI)

The [Shopify Admin API](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api) Python Library

## Usage

### Requirements
You should be signed up as a partner on the [Shopify Partners Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com) so that you can create and manage shopify applications.

### Installation

To easily install or upgrade to the latest release, use [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/).

```shell
pip install --upgrade ShopifyAPI
```

### Getting Started
#### Public and Custom Apps

1. First create a new application in the [Partners Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/apps/new), and retreive your API Key and API Secret Key.
1. We then need to supply these keys to the Shopify Session Class so that it knows how to authenticate.

   ```python
   shopify.Session.setup(api_key=API_KEY, secret=API_SECRET)
   ```
1.  In order to access a shop's data, apps need an access token from that specific shop. We need to authenticate with that shop using OAuth, which we can start in the following way:

    ```python
    shop_url = "SHOP_NAME.myshopify.com"
    api_version = '2020-10'
    state = binascii.b2a_hex(os.urandom(15)).decode("utf-8")
    redirect_uri = "http://myapp.com/auth/shopify/callback"
    scopes = ['read_products', 'read_orders']

    newSession = shopify.Session(shop_url, api_version)
    auth_url = newSession.create_permission_url(scopes, redirect_uri, state)
    # redirect to auth_url
    ```

1. Once the merchant accepts, the shop redirects the owner to the `redirect_uri` of your application with a parameter named 'code'. This is a temporary token that the app can exchange for a permanent access token. You should compare the state you provided above with the one you recieved back to ensure the request is correct. Now we can exchange the code for an access_token when you get the request from shopify in your callback handler:

    ```python
    session = shopify.Session(shop_url, api_version)
    access_token = session.request_token(request_params) # request_token will validate hmac and timing attacks
    # you should save the access token now for future use.
    ```

1.  Now you're ready to make authorized API requests to your shop!:

    ```python
    session = shopify.Session(shop_url, api_version, access_token)
    shopify.ShopifyResource.activate_session(session)

    shop = shopify.Shop.current() # Get the current shop
    product = shopify.Product.find(179761209) # Get a specific product

    # execute a graphQL call
    shopify.GraphQL().execute("{ shop { name id } }")
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use temp to initialize a Session and execute a command:

     ```python
     with shopify.Session.temp(shop_url, api_version, token):
        product = shopify.Product.find()
     ```

1.  It is best practice to clear your session when you're done. A temporary session does this automatically:

     ```python
     shopify.ShopifyResource.clear_session()
     ```

#### Private Apps
Private apps are a bit quicker to use because OAuth is not needed. You can create the private app in the Shopify Merchant Admin. You can use the Private App password as your `access_token`:

##### With full session
```python
session = shopify.Session(shop_url, api_version, private_app_password)
shopify.ShopifyResource.activate_session(session)
# ...
shopify.ShopifyResource.clear_session()
```

##### With temporary session

```python
with shopify.Session.temp(shop_url, api_version, private_app_password):
    shopify.GraphQL().execute("{ shop { name id } }")
```

### Billing
_Note: Your application must be public to test the billing process. To test on a development store use the `'test': True` flag_

1.  Create charge after session has been activated
    ```python
    application_charge = shopify.ApplicationCharge.create({
        'name': 'My public app',
        'price': 123,
        'test': True,
        'return_url': 'https://domain.com/approve'
    })
    # Redirect user to application_charge.confirmation_url so they can approve the charge
    ```
1.  After approving the charge, the user is redirected to `return_url` with `charge_id` parameter
    ```python
    charge = shopify.ApplicationCharge.find(charge_id)
    shopify.ApplicationCharge.activate(charge)
    ```
1.  Check that `activated_charge` status is `active`
    ```python
    activated_charge = shopify.ApplicationCharge.find(charge_id)
    has_been_billed = activated_charge.status == 'active'
    ```

### Advanced Usage
It is recommended to have at least a basic grasp on the principles of the [pyactiveresource](https://github.com/Shopify/pyactiveresource) library, which is a port of rails/ActiveResource to Python and upon which this package relies heavily.

Instances of `pyactiveresource` resources map to RESTful resources in the Shopify API.

`pyactiveresource` exposes life cycle methods for creating, finding, updating, and deleting resources which are equivalent to the `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP verbs.

```python
product = shopify.Product()
product.title = "Shopify Logo T-Shirt"
product.id                          # => 292082188312
product.save()                      # => True
shopify.Product.exists(product.id)  # => True
product = shopify.Product.find(292082188312)
# Resource holding our newly created Product object
# Inspect attributes with product.attributes
product.price = 19.99
product.save()                      # => True
product.destroy()
# Delete the resource from the remote server (i.e. Shopify)
```

### Prefix options

Some resources such as `Fulfillment` are prefixed by a parent resource in the Shopify API (e.g. `orders/450789469/fulfillments/255858046`). In order to interact with these resources, you must specify the identifier of the parent resource in your request.

```python
shopify.Fulfillment.find(255858046, order_id=450789469)
```

### Console
This package also includes the `shopify_api.py` script to make it easy to open an interactive console to use the API with a shop.
1.  Obtain a private API key and password to use with your shop (step 2 in "Getting Started")
1.  Save your default credentials: `shopify_api.py add yourshopname`
1.  Start the console for the connection: `shopify_api.py console`
1.  To see the full list of commands, type: `shopify_api.py help`

### GraphQL

This library also supports Shopify's new [GraphQL API](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/graphql-admin-api). The authentication process is identical. Once your session is activated, simply construct a new graphql client and use `execute` to execute the query.

```python
result = shopify.GraphQL().execute('{ shop { name id } }')
```


## Using Development Version

#### Building and installing dev version
```shell
python setup.py sdist
pip install --upgrade dist/ShopifyAPI-*.tar.gz
```

**Note** Use the `bin/shopify_api.py` script when running from the source tree. It will add the lib directory to start of sys.path, so the installed version won't be used.

#### Running Tests
```shell
pip install setuptools --upgrade
python setup.py test
```

## Relative Cursor Pagination
Cursor based pagination support has been added in 6.0.0.

```
import shopify

page1 = shopify.Product.find()
if page1.has_next_page():
  page2 = page1.next_page()

# to persist across requests you can use next_page_url and previous_page_url
next_url = page1.next_page_url
page2 = shopify.Product.find(from_=next_url)
```

## Limitations

Currently there is no support for:

* asynchronous requests
* persistent connections
